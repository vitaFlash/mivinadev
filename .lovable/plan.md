# MIVINA — Complete Website Redesign

A bold, artistic portfolio experience with dark aesthetics, neon accents, and an enigmatic brand presence that lets the work speak for itself.

## Design Direction

**Dark & Electric** — Deep black backgrounds with electric blue, magenta, and neon accents inspired by your video art. High contrast typography, experimental layouts, and subtle video loops create an immersive, gallery-like experience.

## Pages & Sections

### 1. Hero Experience
- Full-screen dark canvas with the MIVINA logo animating in
- Evocative tagline: *"Where code meets canvas"* or *"Digital experiences that feel alive"*
- Subtle video loop (bacteria/neon) playing as a background accent
- Single call-to-action: "View Work" — drawing visitors deeper

### 2. Selected Work / Portfolio
- Grid of project cards with hover-triggered video loops
- Abstract project placeholders with cryptic titles
- Click reveals project details in a dramatic overlay

### 3. Capabilities
- Reframed from "packages" to "what emerges here"
- Three pillars: **Websites** / **E-commerce** / **AI & Automation**
- Minimal copy, bold typography, neon accent lines
- Each capability expands with more detail on hover or click

### 4. About / Studio
- Shift from personal bio to mysterious creative presence
- Copy like: *"A space where technology and artistry converge. Each project is a collaboration, a conversation, a new possibility."*
- Optional: subtle profile image with artistic treatment or abstract visual instead

### 5. Contact
- Simple, dramatic contact section
- *"Start a conversation"* — minimal form (name, email, message)
- Or: direct email link with a bold CTA

## Visual & Interactive Details

- **Typography**: Bold sans-serif for headlines, refined for body text
- **Video accents**: Looping clips on hover, in background sections, or as decorative elements
- **Micro-animations**: Fade-ins, subtle glows, text reveals on scroll
- **Navigation**: Minimal sticky header with MIVINA logo + anchor links
- **Mobile**: Fully responsive, touch-friendly, videos replaced with stills on low-power devices

## Content Tone

**Abstract & Evocative** — No "I" statements. The brand speaks as an entity, not a person. Copy is poetic but clear: visitors understand what MIVINA creates without a hard sell.
